# Drug-Target-Interaction-Prediciton-Method
 
#### This repositery provides an implementation of DTiGEMS+ tool  which located in the folder (DTiGEMS+) and described in a research paper:
(To be published):

> DTiGEMS+: a network-based method for computational Drug-Target Interaction prediction using graph embedding, graph mining, and similarity-based techniques

Everything about the source code usage is explained in ReadME.md file inside the folder

---

#### The repositery also provides an example of node2vec code implemented inside the DTIs prediction code in the folder (...)
